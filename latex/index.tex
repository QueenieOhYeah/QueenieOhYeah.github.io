The goal of this software project is to develop a rudimentary transit simulator in which simulations can be controlled via external configuration and be visualized within a graphics window. In the first iteration, we will limit the simulation to a single scenario involving campus transit via bus here at the University of Minnesota.

One of the very important design fot this project is to separate the graphics from the simulator. This allows us programmers to implement the basic functionality at the beginning and then embed the graphic into the program. Different modes are offered for users to freely selected from to report the raw data or to visualize the data graphically.\hypertarget{index_user}{}\doxysubsection{For Users}\label{index_user}
