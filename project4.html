						<p><em>Project Type: Hardware</em>
						<br>
						<em>Role: Hardware designer, Hardware Engineer</em>.</p>
						<p> The project includes a Version 1 developed in 2017 and an advanced Version 2 in 2018. Version 1 was a count-down timer coded on a programmable logic device. Version 2 was a digital clock manually wired with an LED screen, a keypad and a buzzer. Users could initialize the time and set the alarm by tying in on a keypad. The buzzer would ring at the prospective time. It made use of a chip in model PIC24FJ64GA002 and the hardwares were coded in C language and partially in assembly language.

						<h3>My Work</h3>

						<section>
							<p>The first version of the clock was an individual assignment in Digital design lab where I learned to use VHDL to program my first hardware application. In this application, I allowed the users to enter the time and then the timer counts down to 0. Although it was a very simple application, it did me a favor in my quotidian life whenever I required a timer but wanted to abandon my cell phone that might distract me. The later microcontroller class provided me with an opportunity to implement a more thorough version of it as an individual project. In this version, I displayed the time on LCD screen, equipped a buzzer as the alarm and a keypad to do the settings. I also attached a temperature sensor to the clock so that it can detect the surrounding temperature and trigger the alarm as the threshold is reached.

								<h3>Meaning to Me</h3>
								<pr>
              <p>These two programs are milestones in my academic life that mark my progress in hardware programming that I learned to use VHDL, C and assembly language to make my own applications. Besides, by working on these two programs, I gained an fundamental ability to deal with hardwares which was the ability to understand the hardware manual and extract useful information from it. Mastering this skill, I believe that I can do many other jobs easier in the future.
